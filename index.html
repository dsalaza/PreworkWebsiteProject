    <p class="maintext">Throughout my pre-course work with flatiron school I have started to learn about some
        some very important concepts. This knowledge will serve as a foundation to build off 
        going forward. Some of the things I've worked with so far are:
        <ul>
            <li>Functions</li>
            <li>Parameters</li>
            <li>Loops</li>
            <li>HTML Content</li>
            <li>CSS Styling</li>
            <li>and much more!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        I am enrolled in a part time software engineering course through  <a href="https://flatironschool.com/about-us/">Flatiron School</a>.
        I am expecting to complete the course and be searching for a job by fall of 2023. As I progress through this course and expand my portfolio I plan on updating this website to showcase my projects and advancing skillset.
